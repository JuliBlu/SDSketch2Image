Preview: 
The User Interface consists of multiple features to draw on the canvas. After clicking generate, the drawn image will be used as input for the image to image model.
The model will then generate a new image that reselbles the drawing.

## If the application is running on the server...
... you can access it here: (http://10.36.88.133:3000/) 
(on the target machine, i.e. the PC that will run the demo)

## How To: Start Application on Server (from any machine, e.g. your own laptop) in case the address above is not reachable
1. Connect to server
    1. Open a console (on Windows: Search for "cmd")
    2. Connect to server via ssh by entering `ssh iao-hci@10.36.88.133`
    3. Enter password (Ask Julian Blumenr√∂ther, Eileen Wemmer, Jeremias Lange, or Bhupender Saini)
    4. Navigate to the correct subfolder by entering `cd ./Documents/Projects/KI-Studios_Bildgenerator2/StableDiffusionSketchToImage/`

2. Check for running screens, kill them if neccessary
    1. Enter `screen -ls` - You will get a list of all screens. 
    2. If the list includes \<number\>.marketingAPI:
        Enter `screen -XS marketingAPI quit`
    3. If the list includes \<number\>.marketingClient:
        Enter `screen -XS marketingClient quit`

3. Start the backend
    1. Start a new Screen by entering `screen -S marketingAPI` - the window will clear, this is expected
    2. Navigate to the correct subfolder by entering `cd api`
    3. Enter correct conda environment by entering `conda activate BildGenEnv`
    4. Start backend by entering `uvicorn api:app --host 10.36.88.133 --port 8000`
    5. Disconnect from Screen by simultaniously pressing Strg/A/D - the window will restore what you saw before you opened the screen, this is exprected

4. Start the frontend
    1. Start a new Screen by entering `screen -S marketingClient` - the window will clear, this is expected
    2. Navigate to the correct subfolder by entering `cd client`
    3. Enter correct conda environment by entering `conda activate BildGenEnv`
    4. Start frontend by entering `npm start`
    5. Disconnect from Screen by simultaniously pressing Strg/A/D - the window will restore what you saw before you opened the screen, this is exprected

5. Try opening the application on your local machine by accessing (http://10.36.88.133:3000/)

### Troubleshooting:
1. Connection times out when trying to connect via ssh:
    Solution: Connect to a network **outside** IAO (e.g. eduroam). This whole procedure can be done from any pc - also your own laptop. Use a VPN to connect to the IAO network. Try again.
